Refreshing is a Chrome extension for reloading file:// pages when their on-disk content changes.

How?

I don't know yet. But here are some ideas:

  * extension uses an NPAPI plugin which uses inotify or polling
  * vanilla Chrome extension communicates with a node.js server
  * vanilla JavaScript to include on your page that communicates with a node.js server (not Chrome specific!)
